This project aims to process employee data from the Lyon office to support data-driven decision-making for offering Retention Compensation Contracts (RCCs).
To offer RCCs effectively, it is essential to create objectively defined groups rather than targeting
individuals directly. Group formation should be based on transparent and data-driven criteria to
ensure fairness and consistency.
